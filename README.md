Happy Drivers is a full-stack web application for tracking driver sponsorship points and managing applications.
It was developed as a team project in Spring 2025 for my Senior Computing Practicum course at Clemson University.

In this project, I worked on both the front-end and back-end of the application:

Built the front-end using React and Next.js, with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Helped design and implement a serverless backend using AWS Lambda, RDS (MySQL), and Cognito for user authentication and role-based access control.

Created dynamic user dashboards and secure admin controls.

Used version control with Git and GitHub to manage team collaboration and development flow.

Through this project, I learned how to work on a team using Agile methodologies, implement cloud-based backends, and design a responsive user interface for a real-world application.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
